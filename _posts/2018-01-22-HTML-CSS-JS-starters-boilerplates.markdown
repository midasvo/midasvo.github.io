I often start side projects and every time I have to google standard HTML5 boilerplates. I might as well put some extra time into it and expose a few of my custom boilerplates.

For now I have added three types: basic, styled, and interactive (html/html+css/html+css+js). Everyone is free to use the app and request pulls.

- App website: [starters.apps.midasvo.nl](https://starters.apps.midasvo.nl)

- Github repository: [midasvo/starters](https://github.com/midasvo/starters)

Enjoy! :)
