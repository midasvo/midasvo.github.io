# To-do

Do you ever get that feeling that you just want to start a blog? I'm going to kick off season 01 by just starting this. It will probably not be a very good read, but I just need to start somewhere. I'll put whatever I'm think or doing into these posts and hopefully I'll get further than 2 posts in a year. There is no deadline and I promise not to be overly critical of what I'll post.

I'd like to challenge myself, while no one is reading this, to start a blog and just build stuff. How odd it may sound I think it will motivate me. Of course I have my day-job but honestly I've been trying to program stuff for me but it's not easy. It normally works like this: get a cool idea, think of cool new things to build and/or new use cases, forget about it.

I would like to start off easy, build something barebones that just works and is deployable. Therefore the requirements are that it should be installable with one or two actions. A git clone and run. Or a docker image that needs a bit of config.

A good place to start would be a todo app. I mean that is pretty applicable to the situation right?


So let's do it.

# Currently

I'm currently editing this post in Atom and using the terminal to commit which then updates my github-pages. Honestly I'd like to have a WYSIWYG editor for github-pages. Maybe it already exists, or maybe that's a project for the future.

For fun, I'd like to start off with a JS todo app.
