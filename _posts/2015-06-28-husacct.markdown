    title: Altering HUSACCT with Java

---

I worked on HUSACCT with a group during an 8 week project in the semester Object Oriented Software Engineering. HUSACCT is a Software Architecture Checking Tool, which in short, analyzes source code and compares it to the intended architecture.

Since the application was already very far in development we were given the task of implementing 2 design patterns (MVC, BlackBoard) plus the possibility of adding more patterns and altering existing ones.

The code was developed via Stash on a school server, I do not have the code available.
