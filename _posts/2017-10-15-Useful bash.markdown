# Basics

#### How to move around

Use `cd` to get back to your root directory

Use `cd..` to traverse one directory back

Use `cd DIRECTORYNAME` to enter that directory

Use `ls` or `ls -l` to display the directory content

Use `cd DIRECTORYNAME/SUBDIRECTORYNAME` to traverse to a specific directory from the current working directory

Use `cd /ROOTDIRECTORYNAME/DIRECTORYNAME/SUBDIRECTORYNAME` to traverse to a specific directory from the root directory 

#### How to get your current directory

`pwd`

#### Creating a script
`sudo nano /thefull/path/tobash/script.sh`

After running the nano command we can start editing our script. 

#### The script

A simple script to start with is outputting some text, let's start by echoing 'Hello World!'

Before we get to that we need to fulfill a requirement of any bash script, the `#!/bin/bash` at the start of the script.

1. Add `#!/bin/bash` to the top of the file.
2. Add `echo "Hello World!"` to the second line.

Hit CTRL+X, Y, and ENTER to save the script.

#### Making the script executable

`chmod +x /thefull/path/tobash/script.sh`

#### Running the script

`. /thefull/path/tobash/script.sh`

#### Making aliases

`alias mycoolalias='. /thefull/path/tobash/script.sh'`

The "." marks the script for execution.  

By running that in the command line we create the 'mycoolalias' alias which will execute the script.sh via its' full path.

#### Using the alias
`mycoolalias`

#### Using command-line parameters

User input typed after the script call can be accessed by the dollar sign, an example:

We create the following script:

`#!/bin/bash`
`echo "The answer to the question of $2 is $1."`

Which will output "The answer to the question life is 42." if called as follows: 

`mycoolalias 42 life`
