#### The why
If you're like me and like listening to audio while commuting or mindless tasks such as the dishes, podcasts can make the time fly. My first real taste of podcasts was because of Dan Carlin and his Hardcore History series, after that Hello Internet, Cortex, and Serial. But like all good things there's just not enough of them. 

#### The how
Podcasts can be listened to from your pc, phone and I think even on your watch. Android users can look at apps like Podcast Addict and iOS users at Overcast. If you're on a pc you can also just download them.

#### The list

1. Programming Throwdown

2. CodeNewbie
