# Moving away from Github pages

## What

I have decided to move my personal website (this) away from Github pages and into my own control. It was a relatively simple operation and gives me much more freedom to update & experiment with the website. For people just starting with their own website I would still recommend using the free hosting Github offers but there is a lot to be said about having control of your content.

This article (work in progress) aims to explain the pro's and con's, how to switch, domain/dns and certification.
