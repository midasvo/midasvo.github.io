    title: Prototyping in JavaScript

---


During the project phase of the semester Develop and Maintain an E-Community, I joined a group to prototype an 'idea' app. We used parts of Scrum and iteratively created the mobile prototype. Our concept revolved around the idea that people within a large hospital might have either constructive criticism or entirely novel ideas. Why not tap into that pool of professionals and patients knowledge in order to improve their day-to-day? 



 Users could add their own ideas and use directional touch commands to judge other ideas. We did field research by taking interviews at the university and hospital.  

To sum up:

- Concepting
- Prototyping
- JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- Community Centered Development
